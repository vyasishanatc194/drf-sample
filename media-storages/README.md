# FileAppServices and MediaStorage Classes - File Management with Amazon S3

## Description

The 'Code-Under-Test' snippet includes two classes: 'MediaStorage' and 'FileAppServices'. The 'MediaStorage' class is a custom storage class for managing media files on Amazon S3, extending the 'S3Boto3Storage' class. The 'FileAppServices' class is responsible for handling file upload and creation/update operations in a file management application, utilizing the 'MediaStorage' class for S3 file upload.

## Inputs

The inputs for the 'Code-Under-Test' snippet include file objects, file paths within the S3 bucket, user objects, and optional file instances.

## Flow

1. The 'MediaStorage' class extends the 'S3Boto3Storage' class and sets the bucket name, location, and file overwrite attributes.

2. The 'FileAppServices' class initializes instances of the 'FileServices' and 'UserAppServices' classes.

3. The 'file_upload_s3' method in the 'FileAppServices' class uploads a file to S3 using the 'MediaStorage' class and returns the file URL.

4. The 'create_or_update_file_from_file_obj' method in the 'FileAppServices' class creates or updates a file object based on the provided file object, user, and optional file instance.

## Outputs

The outputs of the 'Code-Under-Test' snippet include the URL of the uploaded file and the created or updated file object.

## Usage Example

```python
# Create an instance of the FileAppServices class
file_app_service = FileAppServices(user_app_service)

# Upload a file to Amazon S3 storage and get the file URL
file_url = file_app_service.file_upload_s3(file_obj, file_path_within_bucket)

# Create or update a file object based on the provided file object and user
file_obj = file_app_service.create_or_update_file_from_file_obj(file_obj, user, file_instance)
```

This example demonstrates how to use the 'FileAppServices' class to upload a file to Amazon S3 storage and create or update a file object based on the provided information.
