# ForecastServices Class - Factory Method Example

## Description

The code snippet is a part of the `ForecastServices` class, providing methods to interact with the `Forecast` model and its related objects. It demonstrates the usage of a factory method to create a new `Forecast` object and save it to the database.

## Inputs

- **name**: A string representing the name of the forecast.
- **user**: An object representing the owner of the forecast.
- **forecast_data**: A dictionary containing forecast data.
- **company_id**: A string representing the ID of the company associated with the forecast.

## Flow

1. The code snippet creates an instance of the `ForecastServices` class:
   ```python
   # Create an instance of the ForecastServices class
   forecast_services = ForecastServices()
   ```

2. It retrieves the forecast factory method using the `get_forecast_factory()` method of the `ForecastServices` class:
   ```python
   # Retrieve the forecast factory method
   forecast_factory_method = forecast_services.get_forecast_factory()
   ```

3. The factory method is then used to create a new `Forecast` object by calling the `build_entity_with_id()` method:
   ```python
   # Create a new Forecast object using the factory method
   forecast_obj = forecast_factory_method.build_entity_with_id(
       name="Example Forecast",
       owner_id=UserID(value=user.id),
       forecast_data={"data": "example"},
       company_id="example_company_id",
   )
   ```

4. The newly created `Forecast` object is saved to the database using the `save()` method:
   ```python
   # Save the Forecast object to the database
   forecast_obj.save()
   ```

## Outputs

None

## Usage Example

```python
# Create an instance of the ForecastServices class
forecast_services = ForecastServices()

# Retrieve the forecast factory method
forecast_factory_method = forecast_services.get_forecast_factory()

# Create a new Forecast object using the factory method
forecast_obj = forecast_factory_method.build_entity_with_id(
    name="Example Forecast",
    owner_id=UserID(value=user.id),
    forecast_data={"data": "example"},
    company_id="example_company_id",
)

# Save the Forecast object to the database
forecast_obj.save()
```

# Forecast Model and ForecastFactory

## Description

This code snippet defines a model called 'Forecast' that represents a forecast in a database. It also includes a factory class called 'ForecastFactory' that is used to create instances of the 'Forecast' model.

## Inputs

- **id**: A unique identifier for the forecast.
- **name**: The name of the forecast.
- **company_id**: The ID of the company associated with the forecast.
- **owner_id**: The ID of the owner of the forecast.
- **forecast_data**: A dictionary containing the forecast data.

## Flow

1. The code defines a value object called 'ForecastID' that is used to generate and pass the forecast ID to the 'ForecastFactory'.
2. The 'Forecast' model is defined with various fields such as 'name', 'unit', 'responsible_person_id', 'owner_id', 'rolling_period', 'forecast_data', and 'company_id'.
3. The 'ForecastFactory' class includes two methods: 'build_entity' and 'build_entity_with_id'. These methods are used to create instances of the 'Forecast' model with the provided inputs.

## Outputs

An instance of the 'Forecast' model.

## Usage Example

```python
# Create a forecast using the 'ForecastFactory'
forecast = ForecastFactory.build_entity_with_id(
    name="Sales Forecast",
    owner_id=UserID("123"),
    forecast_data={"2022-01-01": 100, "2022-01-02": 150},
    company_id=CompanyID("456")
)

# Access the properties of the forecast
print(forecast.id)  # Output: a unique identifier for the forecast
print(forecast.name)  # Output: "Sales Forecast"
print(forecast.owner_id)  # Output: "123"
print(forecast.forecast_data)  # Output: {"2022-01-01": 100, "2022-01-02": 150}
print(forecast.company_id)  # Output: "456"
```
