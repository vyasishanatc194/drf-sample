# CustomResponseMiddleware Class - Custom Translation of HTTP Responses

## Description

The 'Code-Under-Test' is a class called 'CustomResponseMiddleware' that processes the response returned by a view function. It applies custom translation to the response data based on the request headers.

## Inputs

- **get_response (function):** The view function that will be called to handle the request.

## Flow

1. The class is initialized with the 'get_response' function and an instance of the 'CustomTranslator' class.

2. When the middleware is called with a request, it first calls the 'get_response' function to handle the request and get the response.

3. If the request path contains "superadmin" or "custom_admin", the method returns the response as is without any modifications.

4. Otherwise, it retrieves the language from the request headers, with a default value of "en" if not provided.

5. It then uses the 'custom_translator' instance to translate the response data, specifically the "message" key, to the target language.

6. The translated data is assigned back to the response object and returned.

## Outputs

- **HttpResponse:** The processed HTTP response object.

## Usage Example

```python
# Create an instance of the CustomResponseMiddleware class
middleware = CustomResponseMiddleware(get_response)

# Process the template response with custom translation
response = middleware.process_template_response(request, response)
```

# MiddlewareWithLogger Class - Django Middleware with Logging and User Checks

## Description

The 'Code-Under-Test' is a part of a class called 'MiddlewareWithLogger,' which extends the 'UacMiddleware' class. It is responsible for processing the view in a Django middleware. The class checks if the user is a success manager and verifies the presence of certain parameters in the request. It also handles exceptions and logs them.

## Inputs

- **viewset:** The viewset object representing the view being processed.
- **view_func:** The function representing the view being processed.
- **view_args:** The arguments passed to the view function.
- **view_kwargs:** The keyword arguments passed to the view function.

## Flow

1. Create an instance of AttributeLogger to log attributes related to the viewset.

2. Check if the user is a success manager by calling the `check_user_is_success_manager` method of the `MiddlewareServices` class.

3. Set the `is_success_manager` attribute of the request object based on the result of the previous step.

4. If the `success_manager_required` flag is set and the `company_id` parameter is missing in the request, return an error response.

5. If the `direct_report_required` flag is set and the `direct_report` parameter is missing in the request, return an error response.

6. If the `direct_report` parameter is present, retrieve the direct report using the `DirectReportAppServices` class.

7. If the direct report is not found, return an error response.

8. Call the `process_view` method of the parent class to continue processing the view.

## Outputs

- None or an error response if certain conditions are not met.

## Usage Example

```python
# Create an instance of the MiddlewareWithLogger class
middleware = MiddlewareWithLogger(get_response, *args, **kwargs)

# Process the view
response = middleware.process_view(viewset, view_func, view_args, view_kwargs)

# Check if an error response was returned
if isinstance(response, APIResponse) and response.for_error:
    # Handle the error response
    ...
```
