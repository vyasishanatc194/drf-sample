# Celery Configuration

This code snippet represents a Celery configuration file that sets up a Celery application for a Django project. It includes the necessary tasks and defines a schedule for running these tasks at specific intervals.

## Inputs

- **sys.argv:** A list of command-line arguments passed to the script.

## Flow

1. **Import Modules and Packages:** Import necessary modules and packages, including Celery, Celery schedules, and Django settings.

2. **Set Default Django Settings Module:** Set the default Django settings module using `os.environ.setdefault`.

3. **Determine Broker Backend:** Determine the broker backend based on the command-line argument. If "test" is in `sys.argv[1:]`, set the broker backend to "memory://localhost".

4. **Create Celery Application Instance:** Create a Celery application instance with the specified broker and backend URLs. Include necessary tasks and configure task-related settings.

5. **Configure Celery Application using Django Settings:** Configure the Celery application using the Django settings. Autodiscover tasks from the installed Django apps.

6. **Define Schedule for Running Tasks:** Define the schedule for running tasks at specific intervals using `app.conf.beat_schedule`.

7. **Start Celery Application:** Start the Celery application if the script is executed as the main module.

## Outputs

A configured Celery application instance.

## Usage Example

```python
# Import necessary modules and packages
import os
import sys
from celery import Celery
from celery.schedules import crontab
from django.conf import settings

# ... (Rest of the code, excluding the actual tasks and execution part)
```


# Forecast Data Functions(Tasks)

This collection of functions is related to generating and manipulating forecast data. It includes functions to generate the forecast data for the next 6 months based on the current year and month, group and restructure the forecast data, and create empty forecast entries in the database for the next year.

## Inputs

- **current_year (int):** The current year.
- **current_month (int):** The current month.
- **response_data (list):** A list of dictionaries containing the response data.

## Functions

### `generate_next_month_forecast_response(current_year, current_month)`

Generates the forecast data for the next 6 months based on the provided current year and month. Returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents the forecast data for a specific month.

### `generate_grouped_data_from_response(response_data)`

Groups the response data based on the year and month, then restructures the grouped data. Returns a dictionary containing the grouped forecast data.

### `create_empty_forecast_entry_into_db()`

Fetches all forecasts from the database, generates empty forecast data for the next year using `generate_next_month_forecast_response`, and saves the new month response in the database for each forecast.

## Outputs

### From `generate_next_month_forecast_response`

- **forecast_data_list (list):** A list of dictionaries containing the forecast data for each month. Each dictionary has the keys "year", "month_name", "for_month", "for_year", and "values".

### From `generate_grouped_data_from_response`

- **final_forecast_response (dict):** A dictionary containing the grouped and restructured forecast data. It has the key "data", which is a list of dictionaries representing the grouped forecast data.

## Usage Example

```python
# Generate the forecast data for the next 6 months
forecast_data = generate_next_month_forecast_response(2022, 9)

# Group and restructure the forecast data
grouped_data = generate_grouped_data_from_response(forecast_data)

# Create empty forecast entries in the database for the next year
create_empty_forecast_entry_into_db()
```
